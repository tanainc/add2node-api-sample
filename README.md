This project has a basic client for Tanas Add2Node-API and a few example scripts.

The client uses node-fetch, but native fetch can be used from Node 17.5 with `--experimental-fetch`

Please note that the API currently has the following restrictions:

- One call per second per token
- Max 100 nodes created per call
- Max 5000 chars in one request

Please get in touch if you are hitting these limits

# üë®‚Äçüíª How to use

Install the deps with `yarn install`, then see below for the examples

## Creating fields & tags

To create a new field definition you create a node with the supertag set to `SYS_T02`. You'll likely want to target the Schema-node, which would be `SCHEMA`, but you are free to place tags elsewhere as well. This might be useful when creating templates for example

```
{
  targetNodeId: 'SCHEMA',
  nodes: [
    {
      name: 'Author',
      description: 'Who wrote the book?',
      supertags: [{id:'SYS_T02'}]
    },
    {
      name: 'My rating',
      description: 'How was it?',
      supertags: [{id:'SYS_T02'}]
    }
  ]
}
```

To create a tag, set the supertag to `SYS_T01`:

```
{
  targetNodeId: 'SCHEMA',
  nodes: [
    {
      name: 'Book',
      description: 'A supertag for my books',
      supertags: [{id:'SYS_T01'}],
      children: []
    }
  ]
}
```

## Creating nodes

Nodes will be placed in Library by default, unless targetNodeId is specified

```
{
  nodes: [
    {
      name: 'The Hobbit',
      description: 'A book by J.R.R. Tolkien',
      supertags: [{id:'MyTagId'}],
      children: []
    }
  ]
}
```

## Example:Books

This example shows how we can create new fields, and then a new tag using those fields. We then create a few books using the tag, and add some extra content to the books afterwards.

`TANA_TOKEN=token yarn run example:books`


## Creating node with field type reference

The dataType reference in combination with the id of the node add the refered not to that field.

Available dataTypes:
 - boolean
 - date
 - reference

```
{
    "nodes": [
        {
            "name": "Neuromancer",
            "description": "Got the chiba city blues",
            "supertags": [
                {
                    "id": "lpl-rFx55q"
                }
            ],
            "children": [
                {
                    "type": "field",
                    "attributeId": "o0IV60zsM6",
                    "children": [
                        {
                            "id": "yX3HXLVlbj",
                            "dataType": "reference"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
